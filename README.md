# PinScraper ðŸ“Œ
Little web scraping experiment created with Node.js and React (Vite, Vanilla JS)

So this app let's the user search images from [Pinterest](https://fi.pinterest.com/) that has made searching for pictures pretty annoying without an account. <br> This app is a solution for that (only for personal use obviously)

## Features
- Search images from Pinterest
- Similar dynamic UI to Pinterest
- User friendly error notifications

## Updates
- Image title
- Image description
- Clicking the images functionality
